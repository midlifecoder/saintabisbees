                                        <p>This class is for anyone who plans to keep bees or already has bees but would like to learn more!  The class will cover the history of beekeeping, beekeeping equipment, beehive styles and their uses, honeybee biology, how/where to acquire bees, installing your bees, hive inspections, swarms, summer maintenance, honey extraction, pest and disease management, winterization, local associations, and the beekeeper’s calendar.  This class will also offer 3 additional field days for some extra hands-on time with the bees.

                                        <p>Field days are for anyone who would like hands on time with the bees and who would like to learn more about keeping bees all year round.  We offer one field day a month from early spring to early summer, then we pause during the summer heat, and then come back in late summer and end in the early fall.  Each field day we will tackle a specific inspection goal based on the time of year, interpret what we find in the hive, and create a plan for success until the next inspection.

                                   <p>I became interested in beekeeping in 2012 after picking up a book I thought would pass the time on a long plane trip. The book wasn’t overly scientific or technical, it was just an everyday woman talking about her experience as a beekeeper. I was intrigued and thought, ‘if she can do it, then why can’t I?’. It’s funny, because when something is right, it’s just right. I knew as soon as I put those first ladies into their new hive that I was hooked and since then, I haven’t looked back! As the years have passed, I have been blessed to have my best “drone” by my side as we continue this journey in beekeeping. I am thankful that the bees allow us to be a small part of their world and I hope you find as much enjoyment as we do spending time with them!

                                   <p>What I love about keeping bees is watching them pollinate my garden! I am the gardener and Kimberlee is the beekeeper and like chocolate and peanut butter, we keep working together to try and create the perfect combination for happy bees and a happy garden! But life is not all about the bees or the garden. When I am not helping in the apiary or working in the garden, I enjoy brewing beer, playing guitar, sampling Hill Countries finest whiskey, and watching the Texas sunset with my wife and our adopted feral cat, Queso. Now doesn’t that sound like heaven!

                                   <small>Patron Saint Of Beekeepers – Celebrated February 11th</small>
                                   <p>Saint Abigail was a medieval Irish saint born around the 6th century in Ireland. According to Celtic folklore, when the soul departs from the body it takes the form of a bee or butterfly. So, it is not surprising that Abigail also became a beekeeper. It is said that she developed a powerful relationship with the bees and would use their honey to treat illnesses and heal wounds. She became known for her miracles in rousting bees from their hives and using them to chase off evil. Like Saint Abi, may your bees bring you health, happiness, and peace! </p>
